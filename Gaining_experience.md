There exists a catch-22 for many who are trying to break into the IT or cybersecurity fields. That is, most entry-level job postings require prior experience (here is a strong argument that entry-level doesn't exist in cybersecurity). So, how do you get the job without experience? Or better yet, how do you gain the experience without a job? If you studied the topics in the more traditional sense, you should be able to leverage the work and projects completed in your course of study. If you're someone like me, a non-traditional student building a knowledge base and aquiring skills on your own, you will need to find a way to demonstrate your knowledge and skills to potential employers. For most people, this will come in the form of a portfolio. A portfolio is a compilation of materials that highlights your skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences.   

The importance of building a strong portfolio was emphasized throughout the Google Cybersecurity program. Now, I feel that the content covered in that program may be a bit too novice for employers to take seriously. Furthermore, the CompTIA Security+ exam is primarily an exam focused on theory and industry jargon. Very few of the exam questions are performance-based. That leaves me in my current predicament of needing to gain more hands-on experience to develop more technical chops that will improve my chances of securing a IT or cybersecurity position.   

One can take a variety of approaches to building a standout portfolio. Whichever approach one takes, each project inside the portfolio will share three characteristics: 1) a solid plan, 2) hands-on experience, and 3) strong documentation. 

It's important to understand the skills you need to have for your target role. Knowing this will help you develop a stronger plan and enable a more strategic approach to building your portfolio. This can be done by scanning job postings with the position or title that you are aiming for, connecting with professionals already in those roles, or even reaching out to recruiters and hiring managers.   

Once you have identified your goals, it's time to get into the weeds. There are many ways to do this. Immediately accessible to most people are the websites TryHackMe and Hack the Box. Both sites offer hands-on cybersecurity training that is accessed through a web browser. These sites are a place where students and proffessionals alike can build both offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills.

A level above those platforms exist cyber ranges. These ranges are interactive simulations of networks, systems, tools, and applications that afford students opportunities to detect and mitigate cyber attacks using the same tools and techniques that they would use on the job. Cyber ranges are a great tool for simulating on-the-job experience and more and more are becoming available as the need for qualified professionals continues to grow.   

If you're confident in your skills, and have some capacity for discretionary spending, you can build your own homelab. Homelabs run the gamut from a single, low-cost device to a rack or racks of mounted, costly components. Whatever route you choose to go with your homelab, if that's the route you choose, they can be a great way to experiment and learn.

If you're having trouble deciding what is right for you, I recommend checking out cybercademy.org which has a whole section on project ideas or, of course, YouTube University where you can learn from others' experiences and get a better sense of what you might like to delve into. 

Finally, you'll have to package your work in a professionally formatted, concise report. Do not overlook the importance of this part. If you're in the job market like me, what's the point of doing all of this if you're not going to put it on display for potential employers?  Be sure to highlight the task or goal, your methodology, tools used, what you learned, and address any recommendations or remaining questions that you may have. Take notes and screenshots while you're working through your projects and this part will be much easier.

IT and cybersecurity are technical fields. Pairing technical skills with solid communication skills will help you stand out. Being able to write well and communicate concisely will be an asset wherever you go and in most IT and cybersecurity roles you will put these skills to use communicating with the spectrum of stakeholders.

I have started my hands-on training with HacktheBox Certified Defensive Security Anaylyst, a "highly hands-on certification" focusing on security analysis, SOC operations, and incident handling. I have completed less than 10% of the SOC Analyst pathand it has been very challenging thus far but I feel like I'm learning a lot of good information. Hopefully, my brain doesn't overload and crash. More on this next time.
