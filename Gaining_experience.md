There exists a catch-22 for many who are trying to break into the IT or cybersecurity fields. That is, most entry-level job postings require prior experience. How can you get the job without experience? Or better yet, how do you gain experience without a job? If you studied the topics in the more traditional sense, you should be able to leverage the work and projects that you should have completed. If you're someone like me, a non-traditional student gaining knowledge and earning certifications on your own, you will need to find a way to demonstrate your knowledge and skills to potential employers. For most people, this will come in the form of a portfolio. A portfolio is a compilation of materials that highlights your skills, qualifications, education, training, and experiences.   

The importance of building a strong portfolio was emphasized throughout the Google Cybersecurity program. Now, I feel that the content covered in that program may be a bit too novice for employers to take seriously. Furthermore, the CompTIA Security+ exam is primarily an exam focused on theory and industry jargon. Very few of the exam questions are performance-based. That leaves me in my current predicament of needing to gain more hands-on experience to help secure an entry-level position.   

One can take a variety of approaches to building a standout portfolio. Whichever approach one takes, each project inside the portfolio will share three characteristics: 1) a plan 2) an opportunity to get into the weeds and 3) strong documentation or a report of what you did and what you learned. It's important to understand the skills you need to have for your target role. Once you have defined that goal, there are countless ways to go about getting there. It's also important to remember that the point of these endevours is to build your knowledge and skill base and be able to display that to employers. That means you have got to get your hands dirty, so to speak. Finally, you'll have to package it all in a professionally formatted, concise report. Do not overlook the importance of being able to write well and having solid communication skills in a field like cybersecurity. You will likely be communicating with a spectrum of stakeholders.
