As part of my journey, I have been listening and working my through all of the [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) podcast. I really enjoy it. Its entertaining and informative. If you're interested in the deep (dark side) of the web, social engineering, pen testing, or good sotrytelling, check it out.   

A common thread throughout many of the episodes is that the feature character came of age with computers playing a central role in their story. It goes something like this: they received their first computer and became obsessed with learning the ins and outs and pushing the limits of what they could do with it; they got online and found a community of like-minded people and found themselves involved someway in hacking; or they were gamers who made it their business to find cheats in their game(s) of choice. Through their exploits and adventures these characters built their knowledge and skills to become the elite of the elite in what they do. I do not fall into any of those categories. Although my parents were proactive about getting a PC into the house early, my usage focused on AOL Instant Messanger and Napster. Other than that, I was an outdoor and TV kid. 

I introduced several ways to get hands-on experience in my previous post and won't rehash those here. If you're looking to learn more about what you options for gaining hands-on experience are, check out that post titled *Gaining Experience*. I have chosen to build my technical chops with Hack the Box. Specifically, I'm aiming to achieve their [Certified Defensive Security Analyst](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-defensive-security-analyst) certification. I chose to go this route because I hope to secure a blue team role, like SOC analyst, and because it was highly recommended to me by someone already in the industry. I will earn the CDSA certification by completing the SOC Analyst role path and passing a final exam.    

### *For a novice like myself, the importance of getting practical, hands-on experience cannot not be overstated.*

If you're unfamiliar with HTB, it is a industry-leading platform to learn and practice cybersecurity skills. You can try it for free but it there is a financial cost for unlimited access to all the modules you will need to complete a course. The courses are separated into two categegories: skill paths and job role paths. Examples of some of the skill paths offered are Operating System Fundamentals, Active Directory Enumeration, and Intro into Binary Exploitation. Some job role paths on offer include Bug Bounty Hunter, Pen Tester, and SOC Analyst.   

Each path is made up of modules designed to equip the learner with information and hands-on experiences to apply the newly acquired knowledge. Modules within each path contain anywhere from several to many sections and most sections come with require or optional hands-on practice exercises. The SOC Analyst role path covers 15 modules with a total of 165 sections. Modules cover topics like incident handling procedures, working with logs and SIEMs, industry tools like Elastic and Splunk, network traffic analysis, and incident reporting among others. Job role paths are designed to create role-ready job candidates. Once I complete all of the required modules in the SOC Analyst role path, I wil be eligible to take the CDSA exam where, according to the HTB website, I will " have to perform security analysis, SOC operations, and incident handling activities against multiple real-world and heterogeneous networks" that "focuses on both security incident analysis and professionally communicating security incidents." It is my hope that this course will not only help me stand out as a job applicant but also build confidence around my technically abilities.     

Challenges and setbacks   

I am facing a steep learning curve and have already been handed a potent dose of reality. I have had to pause my progress on the SOC Analyst job role path and revert to starting with a skill path SOC ANAlyst Prerequisites.
