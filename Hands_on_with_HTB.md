Intro - importance of hands-on experience

challenges and setbacks

I have been listening to the podcast [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) a lot lately. I really enjoy it. Its entertaining and informative. If you're interested in the deep (dark side) of the web, social engineering, pen testing, or good sotrytelling, check it out. I'm working my way through all the episodes.   

A common thread throughout many of the episodes is that the feature character came of age with computers playing a central role. It goes something like they received their first computer and became obsessed with learning all the ins and outs and pushing the limits of what they could do with it; they got online and found a community of like-minded people and found themselves involved someway in hacking; or they were gamers who made it their business to find cheats in their game(s) of choice. Through their exploits and adventures these characters built their knowledge and skills to become elite among what they do. I do not fall into any of those categories. My parents were proactive about getting a PC into the house but my usage focused on AOL Instant Messanger and Napster. Other than that, I was an outdoor and TV kid. 

For a noob such as myself, the importance of getting practical, hands-on experience cannot not be overstated.
