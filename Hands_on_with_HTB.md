# *Chapter Four: Jisshuu じっしゅう Hands-on with HTB*
![blog 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2870047a-4d69-4c2b-88aa-ef6934a6a4a5)

As part of my journey, I have been listening to and working my through all of the [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) podcast. I really enjoy it. Its entertaining and informative. If you're interested in the deep, dark side of the web, social engineering, pen testing, or good sotrytelling, check it out.   

A common thread throughout many of the episodes is that the feature character came of age with computers playing a central role in their story. It goes something like this: they received their first computer and became obsessed with learning the ins and outs and pushing the limits of what they could do with it; they got online and found a community of like-minded people and found themselves involved someway in hacking; or they were gamers who became bored and made it their business to find cheats in their game of choice. Through their exploits and adventures these characters built their knowledge and skills to become the elite of the elite in what they do. I do not fall into any of those categories. Although my parents were proactive about getting a PC into the house early, my usage focused on AOL Instant Messanger and Napster. Other than that, I was an outdoor and TV kid. 

I introduced several ways to get hands-on experience in my previous post and won't rehash those here. If you're looking to learn more about what you options for gaining hands-on experience are, check out that post titled *Gaining Experience*. I have chosen to build my technical chops with Hack the Box. Specifically, I'm aiming to achieve their [Certified Defensive Security Analyst](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-defensive-security-analyst) certification. I chose to go this route because I hope to secure a blue team role, like SOC analyst, and because it was highly recommended to me by someone already in the industry. If I complete the SOC Analyst role path and pass the final exam, I will ear the CDSA certification.    

### *For a novice like myself, the importance of getting practical, hands-on experience cannot not be overstated.*

If you're unfamiliar with [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/), it is a industry-leading platform to learn and practice cybersecurity skills. You can try it for free but, there is a financial cost for unlimited access to all the modules you will need to complete a path. The learning paths are separated into two categegories: skill paths and job role paths. Examples of some of the skill paths offered are Operating System Fundamentals, Active Directory Enumeration, and Intro into Binary Exploitation. These are focused around building specific skill sets. Job role paths seem to expand on or combine skill paths and aim to prepare you for a specific role like Bug Bounty Hunter, Pen Tester, and SOC Analyst.   

Each path is made up of modules. Modules typically begin with introductory information and get progressively deeper into the weeds. Modules contain anywhere from several to many sections and most sections come with required or sometimes optional hands-on practice exercises. The SOC Analyst role path covers 15 modules with a total of 165 sections. Modules cover topics like incident handling procedures, working with logs and SIEMs, industry tools like Elastic and Splunk, network traffic analysis, and incident reporting among others. Job role paths are designed to create role-ready job candidates. Once I complete all of the required modules in the SOC Analyst role path, I wil be eligible to take the CDSA exam where, [according to the HTB website](https://academy.hackthebox.com/preview/certifications/htb-certified-defensive-security-analyst), I will " have to perform security analysis, SOC operations, and incident handling activities against multiple real-world and heterogeneous networks" that "focus on both security incident analysis and professionally communicating security incidents." It is my hope that this course will not only help me stand out as a job applicant but also build confidence around my technically abilities.     

### Challenges and Setbacks   

Working on HTB is challenging. First of all, I am facing a steep learning curve. Many of the concepts are brand new to me. The Google Cybersecurity Professional certification gave me some experience with Python and SQL but I haven't needed to use those yet. I was able to complete the first two modules, Incident Handling Process and Security Monitoring & SIEM Fundamentals, relativley easy. After all, these are fundamental modules. I ran into trouble with the third module, Windows Event Logs & Finding Evil. It's a small module containing just six sections focused on Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, and Event Tracing for Windows. This was a hard dose of reality. I have no prior exposure to these and I quickly felt lost. I need to do something to put myself in a position to succeed. If I don't, I will just be going through the motions of learning without actually growing my knowledge or skills. I know that when it comes time for the exam that I won't be in a position to succeed. Unless, I take a step back and do what is necessary to build some more fundamental knowledge around operating systems, working with the command line, and networking. I need to become more familiar and comfortable with these fundamentals before I move on. It feels like one step forward two steps back but I just remind myself that long-term goals often require short-term pain or frustration.    

I paused my progress on the SOC Analyst job role path and reverted to starting with a skill path SOC Analyst Prerequisites. Fortunate for me, this exists on HTB. I'm 60% of the way through this skill path now and it has proven to be the right decision. It has given me the chance to better understand the fundamentals of both Windows and Linux and I am becoming more comfortable interacting with these operating systems through the command line. I have also been introduced to PowerShell and bash scritping and have learned how powerful they can be. There has also been a section on networking that helped reinforce the concepts I learned prepaing for the Security+ certification. Now, I'm being introduced to Active Directory. Understanding AD and being able to configure it correctly could be an essential skill as most environments are employing it. I'm looking forward to taking on the rest of this learning path and gaining more confidence in the fundamental skills required to be a qualified SOC Analyst.  

A particular challenge that I am facing with the HTB platform is that it is primarily text-based learning. You read the material, you answer questions, and complete the activities. If you are a visual learner, HTB may not be the best for you. There are images and graphs where appropriate but, I find it challenging to retain information if I'm taking in too much text. What I read ten minutes ago escapes me if I'm busy ingesting new content. Instead, what I have found that works for me is to ingest the content on HTB and follow that up with explainer videos from YouTube University. It basically doubles the time commitment to learning the contentbut, learning the content is the goal and I'm just wasting time if I'm not actually learning.
